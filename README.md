## My Process

### What I Learned

ðŸŽ¯

This is my first time working with a client, which I am so happy and grateful to celebrate! This project pushed me all the way to the limit, I will say that. This experience thought me supabase realtime with edge functions, which I thought they don't exist (also sendgrid email inbox sends), and also efficiency code in web development, how to put a chosen domain in render/vercel, benefits of using shopify and tell the customer that switching to code websites is a better option :), although it's riskier to make a fully functional website! And in top of all that, it made me understand how to use code from before and apply in current projects, for decreasing time spent in development and get the website ready for deployment.

To finish this, the worst thing that I needed to learn was deploying to vercel, instead of render, for more benefits in RAM, and also fetching in the parent of the function that fetches, to get rid of so much time wasted. I deployed the trash efficient version, and I lost my client. The bad result got me unguarded because of the lack of time(just in one day I did all the stock by sizes of the shirts and pants, and the deployment, because of the client's nature to rush at the last mile, instead of watching my work). From now on, I will be more unpatient to phone the client, instead of messaging him, to look at the site.

I learnt a ton, and I will finish this section with the fact that big companies make the website in a specific way. Not for complexity, but for necessity. About this fact and why I include it here, on my social media channels!

### Continued Development

ðŸ”¥

Just get more clients. From communicating with them and tell my thoughts about implementing riches my knowledge of making a higher quality site. Also doing all the functionalities and design with mock images is a life server. I put in my head that I must wait for the images before working on the project. It turned out he gave me the assets the last day, and I have a full day of stressful work, which made me, from lack of time, fail in efficiency of the site, and testing more with my client!
